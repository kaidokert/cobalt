# What is this ?

Work in progress prototype to fit a WebView based CoAT build together.

It mostly reuses existing CoAT Java code, fits into the same directory structure
and app framework. No C++ / JNI native code is used.

JavaScript speaks to Android Java code through `WebAppInterface.java`, and `h5vcc`
API polyfills are constructed via JavaScript injected into the loaded app window
( see `injected_script.js` )

# Todo list

[x] Github builds

[x] On-Host tests

[x] Android tests

[x] Split the Webview into separate class

[x] Merge existing h5vcc code into single file

[x] Make host/development server address configurable

[x] Get user-agent fields correctly populated

[ ] Get platform service response plumbed though

[ ] Startup argument forwarding and parsing via `--esa args`

[ ] Bring over remaining missing functionality from `main` branch.

### Development Notes

APKs are built and published on Github, look in "android" build runs on the branch ( [Link](https://github.com/youtube/cobalt/actions/workflows/android.yaml?query=branch%3Afeature%2Fchrobalt_prototype+event%3Apush) )



Run a local Java test
```
./gradlew test
```

Run Android tests ( needs a connected device )
```
./gradlew connectedAndroidTest
```

Change development host setting:
```
adb shell am broadcast -a dev.cobalt.coat.UPDATE_SETTING --es key "development_host" --es value "192.168.1.100"
```

This dynamically injects a `http://{development_host}:8000/dyn_script.js` into the app context, for
quick turnaround prototyping. JavaScript code edits only need an app reload.

To tunnel connection back from Android to development host for this port,
set the "development_host" to "localhost" and create a reverse tunnel using:
```
adb reverse tcp:8000 tcp:8000
```
